A cautionary tale... This is from one of my own (rejected) papers. My student (Yeping) made this figure, but I take responsibility for not catching the problem. Two reviewers explicitly called out the problem in this critique, it both led them to the wrong conclusion about our work, and made them think we were intentionally trying to mislead them...

**Key Lesson (principle)**: Don't make the wrong thing easy to see.

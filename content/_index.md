# Welcome to Visualization Snacks!

Visualization Snacks is my attempt to provide Visualization Knowledge in small, easily accessible pieces.

**Warning:** This is a pre-release version of the site. I am just putting up the shell with a few postings for my class.

Many people want help with Visualization, but don't have the opportunity to take a class, or do extensive reading, or search through the endless resources. Many of the resources out there only work in the context of a larger chunk. 

What I've found is the pieces I've created for the class I teach {{< visclass >}} are not necessarily appropriate for anything other than the students in the class. Visualization Snacks is an attempt to put that kind of content into a form that may be more usable to others. 

What you'll find (the sections of the site)...

+ {{< link "Snacks" >}} - these are the core "lessons" written explicitly for this site. The idea is to have a form that allows for quick consumption. The goal is to provide the main idea quickly, but then to provide the background afterwards. The why follows the what.

+ [Tutorials](/tutorials) - these are written "documents" that were originally created for my class, or that don't have the stylized form of the {{< link Snacks >}}. They tend to be longer. 

+ [Critiques](/critiques) - are examinations of specific visualizations. The idea of a critique is to examine something closely to learn from it (not just to criticize). 

+ [Papers](/papers) - are my summaries/discussions of papers (or other documents). The idea is that I read them, so you don't have to.

+ [Resources](/resources) - descriptions of books and other things that might be helpful.

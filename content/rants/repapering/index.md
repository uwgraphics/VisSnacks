The **Re-Papering** project is my attempt to "re-write" (summarize?) some papers in snack form. It comes from the observation that when I want to refer people (students in my class, practitioners seeking advice, other researchers, etc.) to papers, the (academic) paper itself isn't the most effective form for what they need. And, sometimes, in hindsight there might be different things to say.

Academic Vis papers often have good lessons in them. However, the form of the paper isn't always the best way to convey the message to many readers. 

This isn't just about length: academic papers are written for a specific audience in a specific style. The goals of an academic paper aren't the same as something written for some other situation (such as, to teach students in a class or to help a practitioner create something).

The goal of re-papering is to present what I think the "Vis Snacks reader" might want to know from a paper. It isn't to give you the whole paper - the paper itself (probably) has more nuance and formal evidence. 

## Why Aren't Academic Papers Always the Right Format?

- why is this novel?
- what did you do to figure this out?
- what evidence do you have to support this?

The cynical view: Academic papers are written for an "adversarial" audience. They are written to convince the reviewers that the paper should be accepted. 
They are written to convince other researchers that this work is different than what came before, and to help future authors differentiate themselves.
They are written to convince skeptical readers that there is certain kinds of evidence

- overly cautious and defensive; don't say anything you can't back up with evidence, and try to diffuse criticism before it happens

- The "style" of an academic paper is usually overly formal and impersonal.
- Academic papers tend to emphasize novelty.
- Academic papers try to avoid conjecture and opinion (or at least sound like they do).
- Academic papers value certain kinds of evidence over others.

- Academic papers are forced to fit into certain shapes (e.g., formats and page counts). 
- Academic papers are often written in a hurry (to make some deadline).
- Academic papers are often a team effort. This means they can sound like they are written by committee (rather than in one author's voice).

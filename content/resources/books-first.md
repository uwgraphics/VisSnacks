If you need to pick a book to get started, I recommend Alberto Cairo's the **The Truthful Art**.

<!--more-->

The question I get asked a lot: if I am going to read a book to get started learning about Vis, which one should I read?

The (very professorial) answer is, of course, depends on who you are and what you want to learn.

But, after thinking about this for a while, I can actually recommend one as the right first choice for most people: Alberto Cairo's **The Truthful Art** (see my discssion at {{<link cairo>}}). For some people, some other book may actually be better suited for you - but you will probably want to read this one first (or second).

Some of the alternatives...

1. I am limiting myself to picking one book. In my class, I have students use a mix of chapters from different books.
2. If you are a CS graduate student and want to think about visualization in a deep and rigorous manner, {{<link munzner>}} should definitely be on high on your list. But you might want to start with Cairo first to get some context.
3. If you are more interested in the human element and how psychology connects to visualization, {{<link visual-thinking>}} is a great starting point, and is  a thin book you can read quickly. You still might want to read Cairo first to get a broader perspective.
4. If you want a practical "let me make something quickly", I still recommend Cairo to get a perspective on how to think about what is the right thing to make. I don't have suggestions for good "tool specific" or highly practical books. What I find is that once you have the foundations, you can pick up the tools from web resources.

There are a lot of books out there... and I've only looked at a few of them. You can see some ideas in the {{<link resources >}} section or the {{<link books>}} tag.

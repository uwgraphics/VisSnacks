These are pages describing various visualization resources. More often than not, this means books - but due to the way the web site is built, books are a [tag](tags/books), not a "subsection".

Note, that for the books, usually what I am describing is why the book is relevant to my class. But if it's relevant to students in my class, it is probably similarly relevant to you.

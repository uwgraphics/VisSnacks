Task/Objective/Goal - anything else is just in support of that
(but hard to define)

Other things (that support task)

- insight [Defining Insight for Visual Analytics](https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MCG.2009.22)

What does this mean to do:
- consider task in everything (all decisions need to be in support of it)
- think about task early and often (don't solve the wrong problem)
- refine task
- the task of figuring out the task (question) is a real one - but make sure it's not a crutch
- design decisions should connect 
- use who/what/where/why/when/how to refine task and connect to design decisions



Write the goal first
Make a table. And then say why it doesn't work

**Critique** is the practice of examining something carefully to understand it and learn, often in a "discussion" format. Critique is a key tool in learning about Vis, and in improving design (for Vis, and in general). It is also a generally useful skill that can be learned with practice.

This tutorial will give you a quick guide on how to do critique with the goal of helping you get started at improving your critique practice, or at least to appreciate why the examples in {{<link "critiques">}} are the way they are. The simple "rules and formulas" here are good for beginners (including me) to get started. Maybe with practice, I won't need them - but I think that experienced designers have internalized the lessons.

Critique is really useful for Vis. In the context of this site, I will use critique to analyze examples in order to try to distill their lessons, often to reinforce more general principles. In the practice of doing design, critique is often a way of understanding a prototype so that we can generate ideas on how we might iterate. Re-Design (see {{%anchorlink "Re-Design"%}} below) often involves critique (at least implicitly), but not all critique involves re-design. 

Critique is really useful beyond Vis. This is why I emphasize it in my class.
{{<quote "Discussing Design, p. xi">}}
Designers and artists don’t own critique. Critique is for anyone who wants to improve anything that they are building or doing. Critique isn’t a ‘design’ skill, it’s a life skill.

What I've learned (see {{%anchorlink "Historical Note" %}}) is that critique is a skill that you can get better at with practice. The {{<link critiques>}} are practice for me, as well a chance to look at some designs and learn from them. If you're trying to become better at Vis, I recommend trying to become better at critique.

## Getting Started

I emphasize that **critique** (examining and discussing something to learn from it) is different than **criticize** (identify/describe the faults in something).

Central to critique is that there is some thing that you are examining to discuss. In our case, it will usually be a visualization. 

Critique is usually described as a conversation where the designer is present (to help understand the design to get ideas for iteration). My observation: the same things that make critique work well as a conversation with the designer can also make it work well when the designer isn't there, and the goal is more about learning (to draw conclusions from a specific example).  

In performing critique, I recommend setting a few ground rules (these are paraphrased from Irene, a former student in my class):

1. Know the purpose of the work
2. Say something good
3. Be specific about problems
4. Don’t dictate
5. It’s about the work, not the person

Which I alter/re-order into a slightly longer list of "advice":

1. Critique as if the person is there (Critique the work, not the person)
2. Understand/Examine first (Understand context and the object before reacting)
3. Connect to intents (if you were trying to X then Y)
4. Consider choices (what choice was made? how could the decision have been informed? (principles!))
5.  Do not prescribe

## An initial example...

I wanted an initial example to show what can go wrong in a critique. This is easiest if it's something bad (so it's easy to find things to talk about). And since the critique errors often are painful for the designer/creator, I wanted someone easy to pick on... So I asked Microsoft Co-Pilot (ChatGPT/Dall-E) to make something...

{{<rimage src="CoPilot-BarChart-Colorful3.png" caption="An intentionally bad chart made by CoPilot." >}}

Yuck. That is so terrible that I am not sure I can critique it.

Notice how unhelpful that last line was. You aren't going to learn much from me saying it. In class I say "try to say something more constructive than yuck."

Let me try again...

If the goal is to create an image we can use for learning about critique, a chart with too many things go on might be too distracting. Consider simpler examples that will be easier to identify specific features.

OK... Here's another image from a slightly tuned prompt...

### 1. Know the Purpose - establish the goals and context

Understanding the context of the object - what was it intended for - is important because the design really needs to be examined in terms of how well it achieves its goals.

For a Visualization, this usually means the task or message that the visualization is trying to convey, which often requires examining what the visualization is for. In doing visualization critiques, we often see the visualization out of the context it is meant to appear. For example, we see a figure from an article (newspaper or academic article) without the context of the story it is trying to support. We should establish enough of the "story" so that we can understand the visualization and its intended message/usage.

Sometimes, you might ignore the context. "I (as critic) don't care what this visualization is about, I want to use this as an opportunity to explore this element." But even in these cases, it is useful to have context/purpose as it helps avoiding other problems (like blaming the designer for something that weren't trying to do).

### 2. Say Something Good

The point here is to show understanding of the object. It's less about saying something nice to be kind to the designer (to warm them up before knocking them down), but rather to show that you have taken the effort to appreciate what has been done (for better or worse).

I change this to "understand/examine first". This is related: if you don't try to understand and examine first, you might respond with the first detail (often negative) that catches your attention. These "initial yuck responses" are rarely constructive. (Although, they are useful - if you have an "initial yuck response" be aware of it, and then come back to figure out why).

### 3. Be Specific

I generalize this (Irene said "be specific about problems"). 

Vague and general statements are less easy to learn from or connect to principles, guidance, or potential changes.

## Historical Note

When I started teaching Vis, I appreciated critique as a key tool. I saw it as something that designers did well as part of their (iterative) process. I saw it as a big element of learning visualization. I observed in class that students who had formal design training (e.g., an undergraduate degree in Industrial Design or Architecture) were better at it.

In my 2013 class I had a breakthrough: one of those students who was good at it (she had an undergraduate degree in Industrial Design) volunteered to do a project: design a single class to introduce Vis students (mostly Computer Scientists and Engineers) to critique. Her conjecture... a single class would help students get started to becoming better at critique. Ultimately, it's a skill that takes practice... but a little bit of instruction, and a little bit of intentional practice would set students on the path of becoming good at critique.

Her crash course in critique was a smashing success. It consisted of a brief "lecture" followed by practice, where students did critiques - and then did critique of others' critique. I thought it was fabulous - I learned a ton. And other students appreciated it too.

Over the years, I evolved that exercise. The biggest difference: I now do it the first or second week of class so students have it as a tool for their learning. I've tuned the lecture part a bit and freshened the examples. But, the activity is pretty much the same. It forms the basis for this document. (If you are a student in my class, you will do this).

A second improvement came when I discovered the book "discussing design". This is an entire book dedicated to teaching critique. The intro chapter (that the authors/publisher generously make available for free) is a fabulous tutorial on critique. The chapter is required reading in my class. The book gave me is a structured "formula" for doing critique (Objective, Aspect, Inform/Principle).

Part of the Vis Snacks project is to force me to do more critique (in written form) in order to improve **my** critique practice. I invite you to critique along with me to improve yours.

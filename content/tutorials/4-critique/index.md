**Critique** is the practice of examining something carefully to understand it and learn, often in a "discussion" format. Critique is a key tool in learning about Vis, and in improving design (for Vis, and in general). It is also a generally useful skill that can be learned with practice.

This tutorial will give you a quick guide on how to do critique with the goal of helping you get started at improving your critique practice, or at least to appreciate why the examples in {{<link "critiques">}} are the way they are. The simple "rules and formulas" here are good for beginners (including me) to get started. Maybe with practice, I won't need them - but I think that experienced designers have internalized the lessons.

Critique is really useful for Vis. In the context of this site, I will use critique to analyze examples in order to try to distill their lessons, often to reinforce more general principles. In the practice of doing design, critique is often a way of understanding a prototype so that we can generate ideas on how we might iterate. Re-Design (see {{<anchorlink "Re-Design">}} below) often involves critique (at least implicitly), but not all critique involves re-design. 

Critique is really useful beyond Vis. This is why I emphasize it in my class.
{{<quote "Discussing Design, p. xi">}}
Designers and artists don’t own critique. Critique is for anyone who wants to improve anything that they are building or doing. Critique isn’t a ‘design’ skill, it’s a life skill.

What I've learned (see {{%anchorlink "Historical Note" %}}) is that critique is a skill that you can get better at with practice. The {{<link critiques>}} are practice for me, as well a chance to look at some designs and learn from them. If you're trying to become better at Vis, I recommend trying to become better at critique.

## Getting Started

I want to emphasize that **critique** (examining and discussing something to learn from it) is different than **criticize** (identify/describe the faults in something).

Central to critique is that there is some thing that you are examining to discuss. In our case, it will usually be a visualization. 

In performing critique, I recommend setting a few ground rules:

1. Know the purpose of the work
2. Say something good
3. Be specific about problems
4. Don’t dictate
5. It’s about the work, not the person


## Historical Note

When I started teaching Vis, I appreciated critique as a key tool. I saw it as something that designers did well as part of their (iterative) process. I saw it as a big element of learning visualization. I observed in class that students who had formal design training (e.g., an undergraduate degree in Industrial Design or Architecture) were better at it.

In my 2013 class I had a breakthrough: one of those students who was good at it (she had an undergraduate degree in Industrial Design) volunteered to do a project: design a single class to introduce Vis students (mostly Computer Scientists and Engineers) to critique. Her conjecture... a single class would help students get started to becoming better at critique. Ultimately, it's a skill that takes practice... but a little bit of instruction, and a little bit of intentional practice would set students on the path of becoming good at critique.

Her crash course in critique was a smashing success. It consisted of a brief "lecture" followed by practice, where students did critiques - and then did critique of others' critique. I thought it was fabulous - I learned a ton. And other students appreciated it too.

Over the years, I evolved that exercise. The biggest difference: I now do it the first or second week of class so students have it as a tool for their learning. I've tuned the lecture part a bit and freshened the examples. But, the activity is pretty much the same. It forms the basis for this document. (If you are a student in my class, you will do this).

A second improvement came when I discovered the book "discussing design". This is an entire book dedicated to teaching critique. The intro chapter (that the authors/publisher generously make available for free) is a fabulous tutorial on critique. The chapter is required reading in my class. The book gave me is a structured "formula" for doing critique (Objective, Aspect, Inform/Principle).

Part of the Vis Snacks project is to force me to do more critique (in written form) in order to improve **my** critique practice. I invite you to critique along with me to improve yours.
